# Discovery-Focused Tagging Guidelines

## Core Philosophy

Tags enable **discovering connections** across notes. The goal is to choose accurate, cross-cutting tags that aid in discovery and draw connections between seemingly disparate content.

**Keep it focused:** Choose the most meaningful tags rather than exhaustively tagging every possible angle. Too many tags dilute signal and make it harder to see the most important connections. Aim for quality over quantity.

For each note, ask: **"What are 3-5 different angles someone might approach this content from?"**

## The Discovery Questions

Analyze the note through these lenses:

1. **What is this fundamentally about?** (core topic/subject)
2. **What tools/technologies are involved?** (technical specifics)
3. **How is something being done?** (approach/method)
4. **What broader pattern does this exemplify?** (cross-cutting theme)
5. **What problem is being solved?** (use case/application)

## Breadth-Depth Spectrum

**CRITICAL: Include tags at different levels to maximize discoverability.**

### Broad Tags (Connect many notes across contexts)
**How to identify:**
- Applies to notes in multiple folders/domains
- Could describe work across weeks/months/years
- Represents a general approach, domain, or universal theme
- Multiple unrelated notes could share this tag
- Think: business functions, life domains, universal approaches, thematic patterns

### Specific Tags (Narrow technical/contextual focus)
**How to identify:**
- Names a concrete tool, technology, or specific method
- Only applies to notes using/discussing that specific thing
- Someone searching for this knows exactly what they want
- Creates precise technical connections
- Think: actual software/tool names, programming languages, technical protocols, field-specific practices

### Cross-Cutting Tags (Thematic connections)
**How to identify:**
- Applies across different technical domains
- Represents a quality, constraint, or concern
- Someone might search "show me everything related to [this]"
- Connects otherwise unrelated work through shared concern
- Think: qualities, constraints, concerns, meta-work activities

**The key:** Choose 3-5 tags that span this spectrum - not all broad, not all specific. Mix levels to maximize different discovery paths.

## Tag Quality Evaluation

**Good tags pass these tests:**
- ✅ Would help discover this note when searching for related content
- ✅ Reusable across multiple notes (not single-use)
- ✅ Describes WHAT/HOW/WHY (not WHERE/WHEN/WHO)
- ✅ Creates connections between disparate content
- ✅ Not obvious from file location or title alone

**Avoid these anti-patterns:**
- ❌ **Location/structure tags** → reorganization breaks these, not discovery-oriented
- ❌ **Status tags** → these change frequently, not stable for discovery
- ❌ **Time-based tags** → dates/periods are not how people search for connections
- ❌ **Single-use tags** → overly specific compound tags that only apply to one note
- ❌ **Content type tags** → usually obvious from context, don't aid discovery

## Format Requirements

- **lowercase-with-hyphens**: All tags must use lowercase letters with hyphens as separators (no spaces, no special characters)
- **Prefer existing similar tags**: Check embedding similarity and use existing tags when appropriate

## Decision Framework

**Primary Question:**
"What tags would help someone discover this note when looking for related content?"

**Secondary Questions:**
- What technical concepts connect to this?
- What processes or approaches are demonstrated?
- What business/personal domains does this touch?
- What problems or solutions are addressed?
- What broader patterns does this exemplify?

## Applying the Spectrum: Thinking Patterns

**Pattern 1: Technical optimization work**

❌ **Too narrow:** Creating a single compound tag that describes the exact scenario
- Too specific, single-use, won't help discovery

✅ **Good spectrum thinking:**
1. What broad domain is this? (the general area of work)
2. What specific tool/technology? (the concrete thing being used)
3. What approach is demonstrated? (how the work is being done)
4. What quality or concern? (the cross-cutting theme)
5. Optional 5th if another angle is relevant

**Pattern 2: Customer/business interaction**

❌ **Too narrow:** Including dates, specific events, or one-time scenarios

✅ **Good spectrum thinking:**
1. What type of interaction? (broad category)
2. What domain or function? (business area)
3. What specific tool/product involved? (if technical)
4. What approach or activity? (the method being used)

**Pattern 3: Maintenance or troubleshooting work**

❌ **Too specific:** Brand names, model numbers, exact repair details

✅ **Good spectrum thinking:**
1. What category of thing is being maintained? (broad domain)
2. What approach is being taken? (the method)
3. If researching solutions: what type of research?

**The key:** For each note, ask "What are 3-5 different discovery paths?" Then choose tags at different levels to enable those paths.
